# Member-Portal
The Member Portal uses a robust stack: Node.js handles server logic, Express.js manages routing, and EJS dynamically renders pages. Mongoose manages MongoDB, Multer handles file uploads, Express-session manages sessions, Dotenv loads environment variables, and Nodemon restarts the server on changes.
